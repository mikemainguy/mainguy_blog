    Online communication is a rapidly evolving form that is changing from point to point individual
    communication to be more open and social.  Whether this is an inevitable path that is driven
    by something basic to humans or if it is a side effect of technological capabilities is a
    question best answered by philosophers, but I thought I'd contribute a brief overview of
    my experience.

            My first interactions online where with Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's) in the 1980's.  In those
            days, folks would dial with 300+ baud modems into computers that were set up to exchange messages.
            Often, the BBS would be running on some kid's computer and you could only access the system late
            at night or other times when the phone was not being used by other people in the household.
            Participants were exclusively computer enthusiasts and kids playing around, exchanging information
            about other BBS's or how to obtain warez.  The communication was often asynchronous and often
            limited to individuals interacting with other individuals.

            As this grew in popularity, some folks started charging money for access to these systems.
            This had the effect of dividing the participants into folks who could or would afford to
            pay for the service, and those who were limited to free access.  This change brought about
            another change, however, and that is the notion of real time communication between multiple
            people.  Once the BBS movement shifted from hobbyists to professionals, the professional
            BBS operators could run banks of modems and enable dozens of people to use the system simultaneously.

            Some time in the late 1980s to early 1990s, large providers like America Online, Prodigy, and
            Compuserve sprang up, enabling thousands, if not millions of people to begin to participate.
            This began the march of opening this medium up to people other than enthusiasts.  These services
            where great walled gardens where people could communicate with other  people who were members,
            but there was very little, if any interaction between people on one service with people on
            a different one.

            At the same time, the internet began to evolve from a government and achedemic project into
            a widely available resource.
