<p>
    After my recent post about the <a href="">java collection framework</a> I realized there was a nice gaping hole
    in my current knowledge of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Map</a>
    interface. I thought I share a brief overview of which implementations are best for what. First off, there are a gob
    of runtime classes that implement this interface, but only a few General Purpose implementations. They Are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ConcurrentHashMap</li>
    <li>HashMap</li>
    <li>Hashtable</li>
</ul>

    In addition to the above, there are some implementations that will let you influence the order that the keys can
        be iterated.  These are:
<ul>
    <li>ConcurrentSkipListMap</li>
    <li>LinkedHashMap</li>
    <li>TreeMap</li>
</ul>

        Finally, there are some highly specific implementations that you probably aren't going to normally need
        <ul>
            <li>WeakHashMap</li>
            <li>AbstractMap</li>
            <li>IdentityHashMap</li>
        </ul>

        And a few more that are really designed to be used as general purpose map implementations, but rather
        implement the interface as a convenience for folks who are using them.
        <ul>
            <li>Attributes</li>
            <li>AuthProvider</li>
            <li>EnumMap</li>
            <li>PrinterStateReasons</li>
            <li>Properties</li>
            <li>Provider</li>
            <li>RenderingHints</li>
            <li>SimpleBindings</li>
            <li>TabularDataSupport</li>
            <li>UIDefaults</li>

        </ul>
