    Recently, the brains in the ruby community have started to use <a href="#">rvm</a> as a way to manage multiple revisions of the
    ruby runtime.  This gives you the ability to build multiple ruby runtime sandboxes on your machine and test out new versions of ruby
    with a minumum of reconfiguration effort.  In addition to managing different versions of the runtime (i.e. ruby-1.9.2-p0 vs ruby-1.9.2-p180)
    rvm allows you to build environments with different gems available to the runtime.  So, for example if you are
    writing ruby scripts to manage servers, you might now need rails and all it's dependencies so you can build a
    gemset with only a minimal number of gems necessary for what you're trying to do.

            It's interesting because this capability is widely touted as a "good thing" in the ruby community, but
            it never really caught on with java folks.  The java installer (for windows at least) has allowed this capability
            ever since I can remember, but most developers I know simply download a jdk and manually point their JAVA_HOME to
            the appropriate version.  In addition, the concept of managing mutiple sets of jar files in your classpath
            simply doesn't exist.
