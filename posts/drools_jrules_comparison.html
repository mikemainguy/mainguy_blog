    Jrules and Drools are rule based expert systems.  A reason someone would choose one of these systems would be
    to enable business users to express business rules in a language that is closer to the business domain than
    something like Java or C.  A second objective is to enable large numbers of rules to be authored
    and executed and run very quickly.  A third third objective is to manage the process of authoring and releasing
    rules into a production environment.

            Historically, Jrules has been a leader in this space, but I think this position is now seriously threatened.
            Drools can now match Jrules almost feature for feature for many users and anyone investigating a rule
            solution should look carefully at this solution.  As someone who's compared these tools in the past,
            I was always disappointed with Drools editing tools for rule authoring, but in the last couple years,
            these editors have been improved to the point that I would not have a problem recommending them over JRules
