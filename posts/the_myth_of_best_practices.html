    I've found the term "best practices" to typically be a magical incantation that people invoke
    to use a fictitious third party expert to support their position.
    When most people say  "best practices dictate" they're really just saying "because I said so" and I
    meet them with extreme skepticism.

    This is not to say that the idea of "best practices" isn't alluring.  Wouldn't it be great if we could simply do
    things the "best" way and not have to think about what we're doing.  In fact, sometimes it might be valid, for
    example a "best practice" in java is to follow a naming convention. The first letter of classes should be
    upper case for example.  I think this is reasonable, but frankly I'm currently hard pressed to understand WHY.

    If you're going to recommend best practices, I feel you have an obligation to be able to explain
    the NEED of the "best practice" as well as the value.  If the NEED is because someone needs to
    control someone else, be suspicious.  If the need is that many people need to be able to attack a similar problem
    in a similar manner, then it might have some merit.  That also means that the "best practices" are
    situational and need to be identified with the appropriate context.
    For example, following a java naming convention in python would not be extremely valuable.
