    What is the difference between being aggressive and being assertive?

        <p>
            From a communication perspective, both these styles might seem similar.  Aggressive and assertive communication
            techniques both are typically up front, possibly confrontational, and transparent.  What really differs
            is the intent of the communication.  For a short explanation, aggressive techniques attempt to answer the question
            "how can I get this person to do what I want?" while assertive techniques try to answer
            "how can I communicate my perspective to this person?".

            The software industry is rife with people who IMHO overuse aggressive communication techniques (yes, I'm
            one of them).  These are folks that often dominate conversations and will pull out 50 reasons why their
            perspective is superior to everyone else's.  That's not to say these folks are personally overbearing
            "know-it-alls" who don't value other people's opinions, just that this particular style of communication
            is overused.

            This aggressive style of communication can be effective in a group setting where
            everybody is using the same technique, but falls apart quickly when the group contains folks who are
            overusing passive or passive-aggressive communication styles.

            As an example, in an aggressive group of java experts, a statement like  "Hashtable is the best general purpose
            java Map implementation", will likely be met with some disagreement.  Often the disagreement will be stated in
            a very straightforward and aggreesive manner.  A recent blog post of mine which contained a similar statement
            was met with a comment of "Newbies beware, this guy does not know what he's talking about".
