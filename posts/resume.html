<h2>My Goal: Build innovative software solutions</h2>

<h2>About me:
    I’m a senior technologist with extensive experience developing solutions that range from excel macros and ruby
    scripts to enterprise java web applications.
</h2>


<h3>Some Recent Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I'm currently building an insurance claim discounting system that processes millions of claims annually.
        Our new version will ultimately reduce supports costs by over 50% and recoup millions of dollars in lost
        revenue opportunities per year.
    </li>
    <li>I helped guide and implement the architecture for superbetter, a social game. In addition,
        I spent most of my time knee deep in the code, making things work.
    </li>

    <li>As a senior architect at a major hospitality management company, I completely redesigned and reimplemented a
        next
        generation mobile booking engine. The new platform takes advantage of enhanced capabilities of newer
        smartphones,
        while still enables less capable devices to function.
    </li>
    <li>As the web architect at a B2B parts supplier, I mentored the technical team manager on effective communication
        skills with his team, process amendments to help keep track of development, as well as recruit, assess, and
        train new team members
    </li>

<h3>Detailed History</h3>

<h4>(9/2010-Present) Redpoint Consultant</h4>
<h5>Senior Architect</h5>
<p>As a member of Redpoint consulting, I've created everything from internal practice management application using
    ruby on rails, to claims discounting systems using jrules.  In addition, I often consult and provide pre-sales
    advice and strategy in conjunction with the principal team and senior management.  I'm equally skilled at talking with
    'C' level executives at fortune 500 companies as well as factory floor workers.  My personal style is direct and
    no-nonsense and am professionally working at developing a higher level of finesse to deal with
    more delicate situations.</p>


<h4>(8/2009-9/2010) Harvest Consultant (Lemans Corporation)</h4>
<h5>Web Architect</h5>
        <p>In this role, I mentored the team leader on effective communication and relationship building with customers
            and team members.  In addition I provided development assistance to the team, regularly delivering features,
            process guidance to the PMO, and mentoring for the operations team.  To help operations, I developed and
            assisted implementing scripts and processes that allowed building new virtualized server environments that
            were up and running within 15 minutes, which is a remarkable reduction from the previous time, which was
            three days.  The PMO was transformed from using paper processes and an outdated version of JIRA to
            The team leader was able to better communicate his vision and implement corporate plans after I assisted
            in illustrating a variety of communication styles to address different members of the team as well as
            business partners.  As a critical member of the development team, I delivered architecturally significant
            changes to the business platform that reduced the source lines of code by more than 75%.</p>
